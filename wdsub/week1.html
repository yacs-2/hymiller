<!--
  Hi Kipton, just want to give you a couple pointers on this webpage:

  Your first webpage is pretty good. You've got your page title and all the headings just right.
  During class, I gave you all <ol> as an example of how you can use attributes, but that was not part of your webpage submission.
  The only real error in your webpage is that you have commented out the wrong paragraph, and the paragraph which you left is in malformed h2 tags.

    <h1>Week 1 Submission</h1>
    <h2>Html</h2>
    <p> Html tells the browser that the content is in html</p>
    <h2>head</h2>
    <p>this is a container for info not displaied on the page</p>
    <h3>Title</h3>
    <p>This always lives in the head. It is necessary for a valid HTML5 page.</p>

    <p> This contains all the context that will apaer on the web page</p>
